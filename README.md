# EPAI3-AdvancedPythonSequence
## Assignment

1. Create a Polygon Class:
   1. where initializer takes in:
      1. number of edges/vertices
      2. circumradius
   2. that can provide these properties:
      1. \# edges
      2. \# vertices
      3. interior angle
      4. edge length
      5. apothem
      6. area
      7. perimeter
   3. that has these functionalities:
      1. a proper __repr__ function
      2. implements equality (==) based on # vertices and circumradius (__eq__)
      3. implements > based on number of vertices only (__gt__)
2. Objective 2:
   1. Implement a Custom Polygon sequence type:
      1. where initializer takes in:
         1. number of vertices for largest polygon in the sequence
         2. common circumradius for all polygons
      2. that can provide these properties:
         1. max efficiency polygon: returns the Polygon with the highest **area: perimeter** ratio
      3. that has these functionalities:
         1. functions as a sequence type (__getitem__)
         2. supports the len() function (__len__)
         3. has a proper representation (__repr__)
